Steps to create a website hosted by GitHub
</h1>
<p>
Benifit:
<br/>
Having a website that hosted by a big company with free ! You can edit the site content easily by login to the website or using git (for more technical people)
</p>
<p>
1. Create new org
<br/>
2. Create a new repo with orgname.github.io
<br/>
3. Clone the repo and add a index.html file
<br/>
4. Go to repo settings, scrool down to Github Pages to choose source for publishing
<br/>
5. We may need to wait few minutes (could be around 10 mins) for github to setup the site. After that we can edit content of the page and the site will be refreshed immediately.
<br/>
6. Setup your custom domain:
<br/>
Go to DNS provider and create a CNAME record
<br/>
demohvh.appnam.com => demohvh.github.io
<br/>
All should be fine then !!!
